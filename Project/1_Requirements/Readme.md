  Distance Measurement Using Ultrasonic Sensor and Arduino : 

  To measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno with the help of a display in SimulIDE.The circuit detects change in voltage using a potentiometer and detects
  distance,be it near or farther and the LCD Displays accordingly.The main aim of the device is to accurately detect a change is distance and voltage at any instant of time 
  using Arduino,Potentiometer and Ultrasonic sensor.This maybe useful to detect location and an abrupt change in voltage.
