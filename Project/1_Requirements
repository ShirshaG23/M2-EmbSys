# ABSTRACT

Distance Measurement Using Ultrasonic Sensor and Arduino : 
To measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno with the help of LEDs in SimulIDE.The circuit detects change in voltage using a potentiometer and detects distance,be 
it near or farther and the LED blinks accordingly.The main aim of the device is to accurately detect a change is distance and voltage at any instant of time using Arduino,
Potentiometer and Ultrasonic sensor.This maybe useful to detect location and an abrupt change in voltage.

## Requirements

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

|ID |Description |
|--|-------------|
|01|Ultrasonic Sensor should sense the change in distance|
|02|LED should glow|
|03|Potentiometer should regulate the voltage|

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

|ID |Description |
|--|-------------|
|01|LED should glow when 5V is applied|
|02|Potentiometer should regulate the voltage properly.|
|03|Connections should be made accurately.|
